                <h2>Welcome to i-Hemp Mississippi</h2>
                <p>Hemp is among the oldest industries on the planet, going back more than 10,000 years to the beginnings of pottery.  Industrial hemp is a fiber and oil seed crop that lacks any psychoactive compounds.  While it is related to marijuana, it cannot be used to get high because it contains little to no THC (&lt;0.3%).  Although industrial hemp has not been grown in the US since 1957, it has been legalized federally in the 2014 Farm Bill.  The bill gives individual states the right to legalize industrial hemp.  For now only state departments of agriculture and institutions of higher education can grow the crop for research.  The state departments of agriculture also have to regulate the industrial hemp.  Already, there are over 15 states who have legally differentiated between medical cannabis and industrial hemp.  States including Colorado and Kentucky have already begun growing the crop.  And in 2015 Tennessee's department of Agriculture will be giving out licenses to grow industrial hemp.</p>
                <h2>When will Mississippi have these same opportunities?</h2>
                <p>The agriculture industry represents 29% of Mississippi's employment opportunities.  Agriculture is also responsible for 17% of Mississippi's economy.  Industrial hemp represented $581 million in US sales revenue for 2013.  For one of the poorest states in the country it is important that Mississippians take advantage of the emerging industrial hemp industry as soon as possible.</p>

                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>i-Hemp Mississippi is a grassroots effort aimed at informing Mississippians about industrial hemp.  Specifically, the goal is to show Mississippians that industrial hemp is a distinct crop, which deserves a place in Mississippi's agriculture.  In order to actively engage the public i-Hemp Mississippi is organizing events such as informative movie screenings, and information booths at special events in Mississippi.  However, i-Hemp Missisippi is currently in the preliminary stage of it's development.  The i-Hemp Mississippi team is primarily composed of students, who mostly volunteer what little time and money that they have.  If you would like to help support our efforts, please volunteer or donate here.  You can also email us at <a href="mailto:industrialhempmaster@gmail.com">industrialhempmaster@gmail.com</a></p>

                <h2>Why Industrial Hemp is Illegal in Mississippi</h2>
                <p>Industrial hemp has been an important cash crop throughout history in America and the world as a whole.  Hemp is among the oldest industries on the planet, going back more than 10,000 years to the beginnings of pottery  The worlds first paper that was produced in China from hemp fibers dates back to around 140 B.C.  Rope that was spun in China in 2800 B.C. is one of the oldest pieces of evidence for industrial hemp use by humans.  Also, medical cannabis use was referenced by the Chinese emperor Fu Hsi in 2900 B.C.  So for 10,000 years industrial hemp has had a mutualistic relationship with humans.  It is important therefore to discern why industrial hemp is illegal today in Mississippi and throughout America, while it is grown throughout the rest of the world.</p>

                <h2>Prohibition</h2>
                <p>While this issue in America is multi-faceted, it can be traced back to one single event.  Prohibition of illicit substances.  The prohibition of alcohol as well as the prohibition of cannabis and other drugs was a very muddy subject during the early 1900’s.  The information that people were given was not only affected by the political environment, but also by the economical and moral paradigm at the time.  Alcohol prohibition for instance took center stage, while drug laws were passed without the general public’s knowledge.</p>
                <p>The prohibition of alcohol lasted from 1920 to 1933 via the 18th Amendment.   At this time the federal prohibition of alcohol had to be done via constitutional amendment, because the federal government did not have the constitutional power to outlaw drugs and alcohol.</p>
                <p>In the pre-prohibition era of the 1880’s hashish parlors and opium dens were popular attractions with over 500 such establishments in New York City alone.  In the following years different factions began to put restrictions on the trade of cannabis.</p>
